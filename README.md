# blackjack-C

Developed a command-line Blackjack game in C that simulates dealer and player interactions, betting system, and blackjack rules (hit, stand, ace adjustments).

Implemented data structures (structs) to manage player/dealer hands, cards, and game logic efficiently.

Applied control flow management using loops, conditionals, and input validation to ensure a smooth gameplay experience.

Incorporated random number generation (rand() with srand(time(NULL))) to deal cards, simulating realistic shuffling.

Designed and tested functions for modularity, including card evaluation, blackjack detection, and ace handling logic.

Strengthened skills in memory management, debugging, and handling edge cases such as busts, ties, and invalid user input.
